Only one side of the space between the house and the property line may be covered with outbuildings, e.g. garages. <strong> A semi-detached house (Doppelhaus) </strong>is a combination of two houses, both built on one side to a common side property line or use boundary (in the case of condominium/partial ownership). To avoid misunderstandings, the individual houses are called <strong>half duplexes (halbe Doppelhäuser) or semi-detached houses (Doppelhaushälften)</strong> bezeichnet. An <strong>end row house (Endreihenhaus)</strong> is built on one side or a <strong>middle row house (Mittelreihenhaus)</strong> is built on both sides of the side lot or use boundaries, resulting in rows of at least three houses and up to 50 meters in length. The <strong>closed construction method (geschlossenen Bauweise)</strong> characterizes buildings that do not have a boundary distance on all sides and are fully enclosed. The <strong>deviating construction method (abweichende Bauweise)</strong> refers to all other building positions that are not included in the previously mentioned categories. For example, these include garden courtyard houses that enclose a garden in a garden courtyard along with neighboring houses, outbuildings, and story-high walls.",

A <strong>'pipe stem property' (Pfeifenstielgrundstück)</strong> is a narrow, pipe stem access road to a property, that is not located directly on the street. The 'pipe stem' is normally the sole property of the 'pipehead' property. However, it is also possible for a pipe stem to access up to four rear properties. <strong>The back lot (Hinterlage)</strong> refers to a rear lot, which is not owned by the owner of the property, but is secured by a land register right of way or as a building encumbrance.",
