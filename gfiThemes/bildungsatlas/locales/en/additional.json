This includes, among other things, interest group offers, an open area for meetings with peers, events, vacation programs and free time. The content of the services is geared to the interests of the young people: they therefore range, for example, from media work and music education to cooking together, exercise programs, games, and support with problems in the family or with the transition to working life. The specific characteristic of OKJA is the support of young people's own initiatives through co-determination and co-design and in enabling self-determination and leading to social co-responsibility and social commitment. The OKJA has a legally defined extracurricular educational mandate and offers diverse fields of learning and experience in which young people can test and expand their cognitive, social and emotional abilities and strengths.",
