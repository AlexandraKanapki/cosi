# CoSI â€“ Cockpit for Social Infrastructure

The [CoSI protoype](https://github.com/citysciencelab/cosi-prototype) was developed in 2019 by the CityScienceLab as a proof of concept.
The prototype has since been adapted to work in the [Urban Data Platform](http://www.urbandataplatform.hamburg/) environment and is now based on the [Masterportal](https://bitbucket.org/geowerkstatt-hamburg/masterportal/src) (Hamburg's Urban Data Platform Web-Gis) code.

CoSI is a web-GIS application currently evolving towards a planning support system for social infrastructure planners.
CoSI offers a variety of analysis and simulation modules

# Documentation - tbc

This file is added to "masterportal" repo to keep the "empty" addons folder. The addons folder is needed by webpack.

In case you need to clone an "addons" repository inside this folder, do the following:

1: Because cloning into a non empty folder is not allowed, DELETE THIS FILE BEFORE CLONING any repository inside this folder.

2: Clone the desired repository

3: Revert the deletion after cloning is finished.
